Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. :)

I followed the easy guide from [JONATHAN MCGLONE](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), there is great examples at his personal pages too ( e.g. [https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io](https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io))
